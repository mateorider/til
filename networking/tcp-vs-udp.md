# TCP vs UDP
## June 17, 2019

TCP is connection oriented (ie. the SYN-ACK handshake). UDP is connectionless.

Better example from [this dev.to post](https://dev.to/georgeoffley/comment/ehm):

TCP:
You and a friend need to share a toy:
You ask a friend if he can play with the toy.
Your friend asks you if you actually asked him for the toy.
You tell your friend that you asked for that toy.
He gives you the toy.

UDP:
Your friend throws a toy at you and walks away.
