# Concurrency vs Parallelism
## March 9, 2020

To illustrate the difference between Concurrency and Parallelism, think of a trip to the grocery store. 

*Concurrency* - You have multiple items you need to buy. You can go around and get the items in any order you like but you can only work on one item at a time.


*Parallelism* - You have multiple items you need to buy AND you have friends that can help you get those items simultaneously.
